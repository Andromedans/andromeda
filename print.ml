(** Pretty-printing of expressions with the Ocaml [Format] library. *)

(** Print an expression, possibly placing parentheses around it. We always
    print things at a given "level" [at_level]. If the level exceeds the
    maximum allowed level [max_level] then the expression should be parenthesized.

    Let us consider an example. When printing nested applications, we should print [App
    (App (e1, e2), e3)] as ["e1 e2 e3"] and [App(e1, App(e2, e3))] as ["e1 (e2 e3)"]. So
    if we assign level 1 to applications, then during printing of [App (e1, e2)] we should
    print [e1] at [max_level] 1 and [e2] at [max_level] 0.
