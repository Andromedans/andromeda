(** Can we use eta hints to deal with commutativity? *)

(** Suppose we have a commutative operation. *)
constant N : Type
constant plus : N -> N -> N
constant plus_commute : forall (x y : N), plus x y == plus y x

(* And we have a type which depends on N *)
constant List : N -> Type

(* And we have a list of size m+n. *)
constant m : N
constant n : N
constant lst : List (plus m n)

(** Then we can convince Andromeda that lst has size n+m. *)
check with equality_in betas hints handle
  let _ = hint plus_commute in
    (lst : List (plus n m))
