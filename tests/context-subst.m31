(* First a nice simple substitution. *)

constant A : Type

let x = assume x : A in x

let P = assume P : A -> Type in P

let y = assume y : P x in y

check y where P = (lambda (z : A), A)

(* Substitute an atom with something that depends on it? Seems to work. *)

constant f : A -> A

check (y where x = f x)
