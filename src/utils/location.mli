(** Source code locations

    To show the user what piece of code is causing errors, we tag each construct
    with a corresponding location in the source. This consists of the name of
    the file and starting and ending position in the file (i.e. line and column
    number).

    To keep type definitions clean, we write each definition with two mutually
    dependent types, say [ty] and [ty'], where [ty] consists of a [ty'] and a
    location, while [ty'] declares the constructors, which refer back to [ty].

    For example, annotated terms of untyped lambda calculus may be defined as
    {[
      type term = term' * Location.t
      and term' =
        | Var of string
        | App of term * term
        | Abs of string * term
    ]} *)

(** Type of locations. *)
type t

(** Type of located things. *)
type 'a located = private {thing: 'a; loc: t}

(** Print a location. *)
val print : t -> Format.formatter -> unit

(** Unknown location. *)
val unknown : t

(** Make a location from two lexing positions. *)
val make : Lexing.position -> Lexing.position -> t

(** Create a located thing. *)
val locate : 'a -> t -> 'a located
