ABSTRACT:

Proof assistants verify that inputs are correct up to judgmental equality.
Proofs are easier and smaller if equalities without computational content are
verified by an oracle, because proof terms for these equations can be omitted.
In order to keep judgmental equality decidable, though, typical proof assistants
use a limited definition implemented by a fixed equivalence algorithm.  While
other equalities can be expressed using propositional identity types and
explicit equality proofs and coercions, in some situations these create
prohibitive levels of overhead in the proof.

Voevodsky has proposed a type theory with two identity types, one propositional
and one judgmental. This lets us hypothesize new judgmental equalities for use
during type checking, but generally renders the equational theory undecidable
without help from the user.

Rather than reimpose the full overhead of term-level coercions for judgmental
equality, we propose algebraic effect handlers as a general mechanism to provide
local extensions to the proof assistant's algorithms.  As a special case, we
retain a simple form of handlers even in the final proof terms, small
proof-specific hints that extend the trusted verifier in sound ways.
